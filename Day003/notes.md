# Day 003 Notes

## Key Takeaways
- Indentation defines code blocks (use 4 spaces)
- Conditions are evaluated top to bottom
- Use elif instead of multiple if statements for efficiency
- Ternary operator is great for simple conditions

## Common Patterns
```python
# Check multiple conditions
if condition1 and condition2:
    # both must be true

if condition1 or condition2:
    # at least one must be true
```

## Practice Ideas
- Build a simple quiz game
- Create a password strength checker
- Make a ticket pricing system
