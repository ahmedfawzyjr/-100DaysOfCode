# Day 004: For Loops

## 📅 Date: Day 4

## 🎯 Today's Objectives
- Understand for loop syntax
- Learn to iterate over sequences
- Master range() function
- Practice nested loops

## 📝 What I Learned
- for loops iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges)
- range(start, stop, step) generates number sequences
- break and continue control loop flow

## 💻 Code Summary
Built various programs using for loops for iteration and pattern generation.

## 🔗 Resources

## ✅ Challenges Completed
- Pattern printing
- Sum calculator
- Multiplication table generator

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Plan
Learn while loops and loop control statements
